# Purpose

This repository contains the CI for AlmaLinux Atomic SIG images.

# Contributing

We welcome contributions to all parts of the AlmaLinux project. Describe how your contributors might help with what you're doing!

## Contributing - Code and Design

Describe in a bit more detail how the project is structured and how you would like contributors to behave. For example:

Before submitting code changes, please check if there are any open issues or pull requests that cover your proposal. If not, open an issue with a brief description and so you can discuss it with us first. This helps avoid duplicated work and ensures proposed changes align with project goals. This can be your anticipated workflow:

- Create an issue describing your changes.
- Await confirmation from contributors.
- Fork the project.
- Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
- Add your code, documentation, etc.
- Submit a pull request (PR). All PRs should target the `main` or `master` branch.

After review and approval, the changes will be merged and deployed.

## Reporting a Bug

Describe the important things for bug reporting. The org has bug report templates, but you can also create your own.

## Requesting a Feature

Describe the important things for requesting a feature. For example:

1. [Search existing issues](issues) to see if the feature has already been requested. If so, give it a thumbs up, +1, or a comment on your use-case.
2. If no similar request exists, open a new issue. Please clearly explain why the feature is needed and provide a detailed use case.

## Change Approval Process

- Minor or cosmetic changes (typos, small style tweaks) can be reviewed and approved by any contributor with merge rights.
- Larger changes should be agreed on as a SIG.
